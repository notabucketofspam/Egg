  <b>Hail traveler!</b> If you're reading this, you may be looking for
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Eggonomics Board Game</span>, or,
  more specifically, its fourth iteration. Well you're
  <abbr title="about to enter the seventh circle of hell"> in luck</abbr>! Just
  follow these steps to install the requisite content and you'll be playing
  Soon<sup style="font-size: 60%;">TM</sup>
  <ol style="margin: 0px auto 0px auto;" start="0">
    <li>
      Before anything else, make sure that you and your squadmates have been
      granted express written permission to the assets utilized in
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Eggonomics Board Game</span>.
      To do so, you can email: <code>${developerEmail}</code>.
      Important note: you must have a <em>valid</em>
      <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Account</a>
      in order to gain access.
    </li>
    <li>
      With that out of the way, head over to 
      <a href="https://script.google.com/home/projects/1tI0Sq9o83T5QAyx8UaKhVQ0zIKo1QjsoXvtk2sG71D8Ingrrxz9visUg"
        target="_blank">the Google Apps Script project</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Go to the <code>Editor</code> tab (on the left, the little <code>&lt;&gt;</code> sign).
      Hit the <code>&#11166;Run</code> button to execute the <code>newUsersPleaseRunThis()</code> function.
      There will be a pop-up saying something about <code>Authorization required</code>.
      Click <code>Review permissions</code>, sign in with your Google Account, 
      click <code>Continue</code>, and finally click <code>Allow</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Somewhere near the top right, there's a button that says <code>Deploy</code>.
      Click that, then from the dropdown menu select <code>Test deployments</code>.
      On the right of the pop-up, there's a button to <code>Install</code> the
      application as a Google Workspace Add-on.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now it's time for some spreadsheet shenanigans. Go to
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZwjHj7uTM4KLqy7jkW8ADDMuBtVwCJSYQpn_2wZg8NA/edit"
        target="_blank">the Eggonomics Financial Template</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hit <code>File</code> (top left), then <code>Make a copy</code>. Under the
      <code>Folder</code> option, put the spreadsheet somewhere in your
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> where your
      squadmates will be able to access and edit it (i.e. a folder shared with
      them as editors). Important note: only one group member has to do this step.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the new spreadsheet copy, select the Eggonomics icon from the side panel
      (if the side panel is hidden, there's a small left-facing arrow in the
      bottom right to show it). Wait for the add-on to load; if it doesn't seem to
      be doing anything, press <code>ctrl + F5</code> to perform a cache refresh.
    </li>
    <li>
      The app will (yet again) ask for permissions.
    </li>
    <li>
      At this point everything is effectively ready; simply click on the
      <code>Open webapp</code> button to bring up the central user interface.
      This is where all in-game actions will be performed; there's no need to
      interact with the underlying spreadsheet, it's only there for backend reasons.
    </li>
  </ol>
  That's <abbr title="probably, hopefully">basically</abbr> it! A brand new
  <em>egg</em>sperience awaits you in
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Eggonomics Board Game</span>.
  If and when technical developments occur, they'll be listed in the changelog
  on the right.
